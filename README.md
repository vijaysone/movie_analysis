# Movie Analysis Project

## Description
This project analyzes a dataset of top-rated movies and performs various tasks such as generating descriptive statistics, filtering movies based on specific criteria, and visualizing data.

## Tasks
1. Import the data set into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Generate descriptive statistics for the budget of all the movies.
3. Find out how many of the top-rated movies produced in the United States have a PG-13 rating.
4. Find out whether any of the top-rated movies produced in 2014 were not produced in the United States.
5. Find the percentage of the top-rated movies that are in:
   - 1 genre only
   - 2 genres only
   - 3 genres only
6. Convert the budget and gross values from â€œdollars" to "dollars in millions" for all top-rated movies. Round the converted values down to 3 decimal places.
7. List all details for the top 10 movies with the highest profit, sorted from highest to lowest.
